# Solis - Solana Wallet Manager
Solis is an open-source crypto multi-wallet management tool frontend that is free to fork and edit as your own. You can connect it to different blockchains for the app to become a real wallet app with real adresses, private keys and balances. In it's current form, this frontend is still visually unfinished, as certain elements don't look as polished as they should. You are free to use this frontend for your own multi wallet management tool.
